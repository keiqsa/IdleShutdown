# Shutdown When IDLE Windows

fork https://github.com/orvado/Idle-Shutdown/tree/master

Automatically shut down a Windows PC if it has not been used for 35 minutes and then show the message "Winodws will shut down in 5 minutes".
If you close the message within 5 minutes, the computer shutdown will be cancelled.
If the system does not shut down gracefully within 60 seconds, the application will start killing all user processes.
